- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TypeErrorDev and I've just started my self taught journey to becoming a Front End Developer. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in always improving the environment I'm in, whether its a outside, in school, or at work. My daily goal is to ensure that I contribute to the improvement of the organization, and to always learn something

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS. This learning journey (hm, I should use that saying more) has been some of the most fun I've had while learning. Being able to control my learning pace and being able to implement what I've learned in my own way has been vital to me solidifying my understanding of the materials.
