- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TypeErrorDev and I've just started my self taught journey to becoming a Front End Developer. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in always improving the environment I'm in, whether its outside, in school, or at work. My daily goal is to ensure that I contribute to the improvement of my environment, and to always learn something to better myself.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS. This learning journey (hm, I should use that saying more) has been some of the most fun I've had in recent years. Being able to control my learning pace and able to implement what I've learned in my own way has been vital to me solidifying my understanding of the materials.
